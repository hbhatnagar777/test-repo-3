"""File for converting / matching an image (screenshot) to text

This file consists of a class named: ScreenshotAnalyzer, which can be used for
converting an image to text or matching an image with reference text

All methods are static, so there is no need for instance creation


ScreenshotAnalyzer
=======

    get_text()                      --  Returns the text after analyzing the image
                                        optionally saving .txt file as well

    get_match_score()               --  Returns the percentage match between texts

    match_text()                    --  Returns whether the actual text matches with expected 
                                        list of texts with respect to a threshold
